# PixelStreaming-test-task

The PixelStreaming application consists of two parts:
1. Frontend. This is a reactive application that interacts with the Pixel Streaming infrastructure and fabric js library
2. backend. A websocket was created to help with the frontend and will be able to handle more tasks in the future.

Both parts need to be running for the application to work properly:
1. The frontend:
   npm install
   Install your package.json

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. The backend: 

need to use node v16.x

npm install
Install your package.json

npm run dev
Runs the app in the development mode.
